Jaimie also travels this section of the kingsroad in \"A Feast for Crows\" stopping in a stable (likely in the nearby town of Brindlewood) and at an inn cellar (likely Ivy Inn). It is unknown which house controls the land surrounding Ivy Inn, but it is clearly in the Crownlands. Both House Hogg of Sows Horn (directly north along the Kingsroad) and House Pyle (to the southeast) are likely candidates, with House Cargyll, a ruined keep to the southwest being a likely historical occupant. House Hogg oversee lands that are sworn directly to House Hayford, so it is likely that any lands surround Ivy Inn are operated in the same way.",
